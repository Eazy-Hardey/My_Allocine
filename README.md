## Task
In this project, we will have to work with a database containing multiple tables. 

## Description
This project will tackle one of the main tool to work with Data. You've probably heard of this tool: SQL.
SQL Structured Query Language is a standardized programming language that's used to manage relational databases and perform various operations on the data in them. Initially created in the 1970s, SQL is regularly used not only by database administrators, but also by developers writing data integration scripts and data analysts looking to set up and run analytical queries.
The uses of SQL include modifying database table and index structures; adding, updating and deleting rows of data; and retrieving subsets of information from within a database for transaction processing and analytics applications. Queries and other SQL operations take the form of commands written as statements -- commonly used SQL statements include select, add, insert, update, delete, create, alter and truncate.
SQL became the de facto standard programming language for relational databases after they emerged in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Also known as SQL databases, relational systems comprise a set of tables containing data in rows and columns. Each column in a table corresponds to a category of data -- for example, customer name or address -- while each row contains a data value for the intersecting column.
The sample database represents some of the data storage and retrieval about a movie related industry. Most of the people loves to watch movie, and for all of them we are providing a sample information about the movie related questions coming to their mind. This design of database will make it easier to the movie lovers to know the curiosities about the movies.
